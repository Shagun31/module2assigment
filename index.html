                This is a list of notable beef dishes and foods, whereby beef is used as a primary ingredient. Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle. Beef can be harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
                  Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[1] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009, Argentines consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person; people in the U.S.
                    ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.[
